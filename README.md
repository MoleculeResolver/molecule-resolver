The **moleculeresolver** was born out of the need to annotate large datasets with accurate structural information fast and to crosscheck whether given metadata (name, SMILES) agrees with each other. It also allows to efficiently compare whether structures are available in two large datasets. 

In short it's a Python module that allows you to retrieve molecular structures from multiple chemical databases, perform crosschecks to ensure data reliability, and standardize the best representation of molecules. It also provides functions for comparing molecules and sets of molecules based on specific configurations. This makes it a useful tool for researchers, chemists, or anyone working in computational chemistry / cheminformatics who needs to ensure they are working with the best available data for a molecule. The tool

## Installation

The package is available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/molecule-resolver/):

```sh
pip install molecule-resolver
```
While the source code is available here: [https://github.com/MoleculeResolver/molecule-resolver](https://github.com/MoleculeResolver/molecule-resolver)

## Features

- **üîç Retrieve Molecular Structures**: Fetch molecular structures from different chemical databases, including PubChem, Comptox, Chemo, and others.
- **üÜî Support for Different Identifier Types**: Retrieve molecular structures using a variety of identifier types, including CAS numbers, SMILES, InChI, InChIkey and common names.
- **‚úÖ Cross-check Capabilities**: Use data from multiple sources to verify molecular structures and identify the best representation.
- **üîÑ Molecule Comparison**: Compare molecules or sets of molecules based on their structure, properties, and specified ‚öôÔ∏è configurations.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Standardization**: Standardize molecular structures, including handling isomers, tautomers, and isotopes.
- **üíæ Caching Mechanism**: Use local caching to store molecules and reduce the number of repeated requests to external services, improving performance and reducing latency.

## üöÄ Usage

### Initialization

To use **Molecule Resolver**, first import and initialize the `MoleculeResolver` class. it is supposed to be used as a context manager:

```python
from moleculeresolver import MoleculeResolver

with MoleculeResolver(available_service_API_keys={"chemeo": "YOUR_API_KEY"}) as mr:
    ...
```

### Retrieve and Compare Molecules by Name and CAS

Retrieve a molecule using both its common name and CAS number, then compare the two to ensure they represent the same structure:

```python
from rdkit import Chem
from moleculeresolver import MoleculeResolver

with MoleculeResolver(available_service_API_keys={"chemeo": "YOUR_API_KEY"}) as mr:
    molecule_name = mr.find_single_molecule(["aspirin"], ["name"])
    molecule_cas = mr.find_single_molecule(["50-78-2"], ["cas"])
    
    are_same = mr.are_equal(Chem.MolFromSmiles(molecule_name.SMILES), 
                            Chem.MolFromSmiles(molecule_cas.SMILES))
    print(f"Are the molecules the same? {are_same}")
```

### Parallelized Molecule Retrieval and Saving to JSON

Use the parallelized version to retrieve multiple molecules. If a large number of molecules is searched, moleculeresolver will try to use batch download capabilities whenever the database supports this.

```python
import json
from moleculeresolver import MoleculeResolver

molecule_names = ["aspirin", "propanol", "ibuprofen", "non-exixtent-name"]
not_found_molecules = []
molecules_dicts = {}

with MoleculeResolver(available_service_API_keys={"chemeo": "YOUR_API_KEY"}) as mr:
    molecules = mr.find_multiple_molecules_parallelized(molecule_names, [["name"]] * len(molecule_names))
    for name, molecule in zip(molecule_names, molecules):
        if molecule:
            molecules_dicts[name] = molecule.to_dict(found_molecules='remove')
        else:
            not_found_molecules.append(name)

with open("molecules.json", "w") as json_file:
    json.dump(molecules_dicts, json_file, indent=4)

print(f"Molecules not found: {not_found_molecules}")
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The `MoleculeResolver` class allows users to configure various options like:

- **API Keys**: Set API keys for accessing different molecular databases. Currently only chemeo needs one.
- **Standardization Options**: Choose how to handle molecular standardization (e.g., normalizing functional groups, disconnecting metals, handling isomers, etc.).
- **Differentiation Settings**: Options for distinguishing between isomers, tautomers, and isotopes.
